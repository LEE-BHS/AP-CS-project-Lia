    <p><a href="https://replit.com/@LiaLaurence/CokeMachine">Vending Machine code</a></p>
    <p>  One of my Projects for my summer homework was a vending machine, coded with python on Repl.it. This project allows you to insert quarters, dimes, or nickels and tells you how much more you owe until you reach the full amount of fifty cents. If you were to insert an invalid amount, the machine would continue to say “Insert coin:”, until you insert a valid amount.</p>

    <h2>Drawing App Project</h2>
    <p>The app that my partner and I have been planning is a task list for kids to make doing things like chores and homework fun. The main design as shown below has a task list with main tasks and tasks that go underneath that topic. Whenever the person completes their task, they get in game currency to make accessories for their profile.</p>

       <p><a href="https://easel.inventables.com/projects/mt5RfJg5h2oWLKBI16UvyA">Ornament on Easel</a></p>
      <p>This is a project I made when I was in middle school for a 3D modeling class, created on Easel. This assignment required you to make a custom ornament that was a 3 by 3in with your name on it.</p>
