      <h2>Hangman Game</h2>
      <p><a href="https://replit.com/@LiaLaurence/HangmanV1">Hangman Game code</a></p>
      <p>  The project that I made for my AP create project is a hangman game. This project helps people with their critical thinking skills while having fun trying to guess the word. There are three catagories given that the player can choose from, between fruit, animals or a random catagory. The game gives you 6 guesses to enter letters and gives you the set of incorrect letters that are already guessed, and if you try to input a letter more than once, you are prompted to input a new number so you dont waste a guess. </p>

    <p>  One of my Projects for my summer homework was a vending machine, coded with python on Repl.it. This project allows you to insert quarters, dimes, or nickels and tells you how much more you owe until you reach the full amount of fifty cents. If you were to insert an invalid amount, the machine would continue to say “Insert coin:”, until you insert a valid amount.</p>
