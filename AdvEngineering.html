      <h2>Beginner Fusion Tutorials</h2>
      <p> These are some of the first projects/models that I have made with fusion. I made these based on the 16 beginner tutorial videos and the tutorials that are being displayed here are tutorial parts 3, 6, and 10. Throughout doing these tutorials, I have learned many different techniques and shortcuts to use with fusion in the future. </p>

    <h2>Bridge Model v1.0</h2>
    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/154nDz0S5uG2mhMgOIjlFTfrXQuE2sRjB/view?usp=sharing">Video of Bridge</a></p>
    <p> This assignment was to make a bridge that can hold a large amount of weight while remaining a stable and strong bridge. The constraints of this progect was a maximum of 400mm and a minimum of 300mm in length between tables.
Notes about assembly: We did not laser cut and instead chose to hand cut each of the pieces. We connected everything using cut outs in the carboard and using string.
Bridge mass = 97, supported 0kg
We used our teamwork in order to come up with a cool design that we would all like the look of. It failed in the aspect of not being able to bare the weight of anything.
The improvements that can be made fore ver2.0 is making the structure more stable by adding trusses and making sure there are no bends in the carboard. </p>

    <h2>Wind Turbine Project</h2>

    <p>    This project was a wind turbine project where we took the kits from kidwind and made new blades and tested new gearing in order to produce the most power we could. 
      I personally woked on the gearing and gear ratios and learned about how much power can be produced by using different sized gears and what the differences between these gears are. 
      Along with these gear ratios, I also tested different kinds of motors to see if one produced more power than the other.
      One of the challenges we encountered was the multimeter not working to measure in Amps, which caused a lot of confusion for us until we eventually had to get a new multimeter.
    The final gear ratio that we decided to use was 64:8 due to the higher amount of power it produced in comparison to smaller gears.
    Our origional voltage was 1.9v, however, once we finished the blades and put the best gear ratio, the voltage was 2.78v</p>
