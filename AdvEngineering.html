      <h2>Beginner Fusion Tutorials</h2>
      <p> These are some of the first projects/models that I have made with fusion. I made these based on the 16 beginner tutorial videos and the tutorials that are being displayed here are tutorial parts 3, 6, and 10. Throughout doing these tutorials, I have learned many different techniques and shortcuts to use with fusion in the future. </p>

    <h2>Bridge Model v.1</h2>
    <p><a href="https://replit.com/@LiaLaurence/TTTpy">Video of Bridge</a></p>
    <p> This assignment was to make a bridge that can hold a large amount of weight while remaining a stable and strong bridge. The constraints of this progect was a maximum of 400mm and a minimum of 300mm in length between tables.
Notes about assembly: We did not laser cut and instead chose to hand cut each of the pieces. We connected everything using cut outs in the carboard and using string.
Bridge mass = 97, supported 0kg
We used our teamwork in order to come up with a cool design that we would all like the look of. It failed in the aspect of not being able to bare the weight of anything.What worked well?
The improvements that can be made fore ver2.0 is making the structure more stable by adding trusses and making sure there are no bends in the carboard. </p>
