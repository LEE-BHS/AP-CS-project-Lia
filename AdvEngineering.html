      <h2>Beginner Fusion Tutorials</h2>
      <p> These are some of the first projects/models that I have made with fusion. I made these based on the 16 beginner tutorial videos and the tutorials that are being displayed here are tutorial parts 3, 6, and 10. Throughout doing these tutorials, I have learned many different techniques and shortcuts to use with fusion in the future. </p>

    <h2>Bridge Model v1.0</h2>
    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/154nDz0S5uG2mhMgOIjlFTfrXQuE2sRjB/view?usp=sharing">Video of Bridge</a></p>
    <p> This assignment was to make a bridge that can hold a large amount of weight while remaining a stable and strong bridge. The constraints of this progect was a maximum of 400mm and a minimum of 300mm in length between tables.
Notes about assembly: We did not laser cut and instead chose to hand cut each of the pieces. We connected everything using cut outs in the carboard and using string.
Bridge mass = 97, supported 0kg
We used our teamwork in order to come up with a cool design that we would all like the look of. It failed in the aspect of not being able to bare the weight of anything.
The improvements that can be made fore ver2.0 is making the structure more stable by adding trusses and making sure there are no bends in the carboard. </p>

    <h2>Wind Turbine Project</h2>

    <p>    This project was a wind turbine project where we took the kits from kidwind and made new blades and tested new gearing in order to produce the most power we could. 
      I personally woked on the gearing and gear ratios and learned about how much power can be produced by using different sized gears and what the differences between these gears are. 
      Along with these gear ratios, I also tested different kinds of motors to see if one produced more power than the other.
      One of the challenges we encountered was the multimeter not working to measure in Amps, which caused a lot of confusion for us until we eventually had to get a new multimeter.
    The final gear ratio that we decided to use was 64:8 due to the higher amount of power it produced in comparison to smaller gears.
    Our origional voltage was 1.9v, however, once we finished the blades and put the best gear ratio, the voltage was 2.78v</p>

    <h2>Rocket Launch</h2>
    <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IV3xfaNzKex9XFcX_e95_T77Y8HPaN3KLkqR4dO3jGg/edit?usp=sharing">Spreadsheet</a></p>
    <p>    This project was where my team and I designed a nose cone, fins and theodolite in order to make a rocket that can launch high, and so that we could accuratly measure the height of the rocket.
    In order to learn more about rockets, and the best ways to design them, we used a website called Whitebox learning where we read about what factors you need to take into account in order to make the rocket go higher.
    This website also helped educate us on how different nose cones and fins will impact the rockets height, and what shapes are more likely to make the rocket launch higher.
    Our origional design had a very small nose cone, however, we realized that making the rocket wider may end up being more benificial. We also decided to use electrical tape instead of scotch tape to help it hold up longer.
    These updates ended up makeing the rocket launch higher, with the height being at 10.6meters instead of 41.1meters, meaning it decreased by around 30meters with these new updates.
    These heights weren't the most accurate due to the possibility of human error since we were only using a theodolite to measure and not putting electronics in the rocket.
    Something that could have been done to get a higher altitude is making the rocket have less 3D printed parts or make the 3D filling more hollow in order to make the rocket higher because there would be less weight. </p>

    <h2>Neopixel Light Saber</h2>
    <p>  This is the neopixel lightsaber that I created and coded using Thonny. This lightsaber uses a batterypack that can be turned on using the bigger red button, and the smaller red button is used to light it. The colors are created in a gradient, which I made two of. There is a red to pink gradient along with a blue to green gradient. The gradients can be swapped using the smaller red button. </p>

    <h2>Hackback Balance Bot</h2>
    <p>  This is a balance bot from Hackpack that we modified. Our modifications include the 'canned hack' of making the robot blush and move away from any object near it, so that it would stop bumping into things, and then we took the hack a step further by including arms. The arms are attached to the robot using servos to rotate them, and modled origionally in blender. The arms where then attached to the pin that controls the lights so that when an object is near, it would throw its hands up. </p>
